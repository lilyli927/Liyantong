            Hi, I'm Yantong Li ‚Äî but you can call me Lily. I'm currently based in Hong Kong.
          </p >
          <p>
            I'm a passionate photographer who loves capturing the beautiful little moments in life and telling stories through the lens. A year ago, I officially became a lifestyle and personal photographer. Since then, I‚Äôve had the privilege of photographing many lovely, unique women ‚Äî helping them preserve their most authentic and beautiful selves. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm truly grateful for and proud of.
          </p >
          <p>
            Portrait photography has always been my favorite. To me, every shoot is more than just creating images ‚Äî it‚Äôs an intimate experience, a chance to connect with the person in front of the camera. I genuinely enjoy every step of the process: from composing the shot, playing with light, to capturing a spontaneous smile ‚Äî every detail matters.
          </p >
          <p>
            Being a personal photographer allows me to express my creativity and imagination. And I believe photography is more than pressing the shutter ‚Äî it's about human connection. I'm thankful to all the amazing girls who‚Äôve stood in front of my lens. It‚Äôs our shared trust and energy that brings each photo to life and helps me continue growing as an artist.

          At first, I was just casually taking photos for my friends, but I gradually realized how much I enjoyed the process of interacting with people and capturing their natural moments. One time, while having dim sum with a friend, I spontaneously took a set of photos for her‚Äîand she absolutely loved them. She jokingly said, ‚ÄúYou should totally do this as a companion photographer!‚Äù That simple comment sparked something in me‚Äîit made me realize that maybe this could be the beginning of something real.

          I started seriously exploring this possibility. I studied the cameras I owned, from digital ones to film and even CCD. Each type of camera gave me a different feeling, a different way of seeing. I also began immersing myself in portrait photography‚Äîstudying light, composition, color coordination, and especially how to help people relax in front of the camera and show their true selves.

          In the beginning, I was really nervous during shoots because I didn‚Äôt know how to communicate properly with people. To make my subjects feel comfortable and capture their natural state, I would talk with them beforehand, learn about their personalities and what kind of vibe they liked. Sometimes I‚Äôd even spend time with them, walking around or grabbing a coffee, just to help them get used to the camera‚Äôs presence. And through that, I‚Äôd catch those soft, unguarded moments.
        </p >
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">
          After every shoot, I would reflect on what worked and what didn‚Äôt‚Äîwhether the composition could‚Äôve been better, or if certain angles felt too forced. I kept practicing and adjusting. Over time, I learned to observe people‚Äôs emotions, to read light, and to tell stories through my lens. From those anxious first shoots to now being able to guide sessions more confidently, each step has taught me that photography isn‚Äôt just about technique‚Äîit‚Äôs about connection.
        </p >
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">
          I‚Äôm still on this journey, and still learning. But every time I pick up my camera, I remind myself: I‚Äôm not just here to take pretty pictures‚ÄîI‚Äôm here to capture moments that truly move people.
